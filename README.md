# Machine-Learning
Machine learning involves training models on labeled data using algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, K-nearest neighbors(KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, with the goal of making predictions on unseen data.
